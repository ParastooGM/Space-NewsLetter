# NewsLetter
This is a space newletter web application on NodeJS that runs locally and on heroku.
The news are provided from NASA's Open API APOD (Astronomy Picture Of the Day).
The API keys used in the code (Mailchimp's API and NASA's API) are only demo keys and need to be replaced by active API keys.
